        "  \n",
        "ans:    python is dynamic,high level free, open source, and interpreted programming language. as well as it support object oriented programming lamguage.\n",
        "features in python:-\n",
        " 1. easy to code '\n",
        " 2. easy to read\n",

        "\n",
        "ans:predined words are already define word ,python reserve dfor working program that have a specific meanings. a programer cant use the keywords as a variable\n",

        "\n",
        "ans:the object that can be modfied is mutable and the object which cannot be modified is immutable the immutable objects are strings and tuples which cannot be change . mutuable objects are list, dictonaries and sets\n",

        "arithmetics operators ,assingment operators ,comparison operator ,logically operators ,identity operator ,member ship and bitwise operator\n",
        "arithmetics operators are used in mathematical operations such as adding multiplying the operwtions ,\n",
        "comparison operaters are used to compare the statements\n",
        "bitwise operators are done in the bit level operatiob=ns there are two types of operator right bit wise ,and left bit wise\n",

        "5]explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples\n",
        "\n",
        "ans:the concept of type casting is to change the data types of the variables these is basically used to change the data types of variables\n",

        "\n",
        "ans:conditional statement work such as if we are giving the statement if (3+3=7):\n",
        "but the condition is not true so it will moves towards the else statement and print the staement which is in else block\n",
